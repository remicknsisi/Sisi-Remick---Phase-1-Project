# Welcome to Your Personal Shopper!

I've created a *Personal Shopper* application, to help users look effortlessly put together without having to spend hours online shopping or drive long distances to visit the mall. By simply searching by type of article clothing (e.g 'tops', pants, 'hat', 'shoes'...), stylish suggestions are plucked from stores and placed before you ready to add to your cart.

By utilizing the submit form that is center stage of the DOM, provide an input describing the clothing type you are looking for. Hit "submit" and see what suggestions the application has for you. To wipe your search history again and check out a new product, click on the "clear all" button and search anew.

Imagine how this application could be improved upon, and what efatures could be added? Filter functionalties that control style preferences, gender, and an expaned database.
