# Welcome to Your Personal Shopper!

I've created a *Personal Shopper* application, to help users look effortlessly put together without having to spend hours online shopping or drive long distances to visit the mall. By simply searching by type of article clothing (e.g 'tops', pants, 'hat', 'shoes'...), stylish suggestions are plucked from your favorite store and placed before you ready to add to your cart.

By utilizing the submit form that is center stage of the DOM, provide an input describing the clothing type you are looking for. Hit "submit" and see what suggestions the application has for you. To wipe your search history again and check out a new product, click on the "clear all" button and search anew.

The application contains the functionality to "add to cart" and display those products and prices visually on the webpage. The shopping cart also contains sum total functionality so that you may keep an eye on the total value of the items in your cart.

Currently, the only products stored in my db.json server

Imagine how this application could be improved upon, and what efatures could be added? Filter functionalties that control style preferences, stores, price, gender, and an expaned database.
