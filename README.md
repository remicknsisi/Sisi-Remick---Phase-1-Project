# Welcome to Your Personal Shopper!

I've created a *Personal Shopper* application, to help users look effortlessly put together without having to spend hours online shopping or drive long distances to visit the mall. By simply searching by type of clothing (e.g 'tops', 'pants', 'hat', 'shoes'...), stylish suggestions are plucked from your favorite store and placed before you ready to add to your cart.

By utilizing the submit form that is center stage of the DOM, provide an input describing the clothing type you are looking for. Hit "submit" and see what suggestions the application has for you. To wipe your search history again and check out a new product, click on the "clear all" button and search anew.

The application contains the functionality to "add to cart" and display those products and prices visually on the webpage. To confirm that your action was successful, the page will alert you and add that product to your cart for you to keep track. The shopping cart also contains sum total functionality so that you may keep an eye on the total value of the items in your cart. Feel free to utilize the "x" buttons if you are having second thoughts on anything added to cart - the total price will reduce accordingly if you do so.

Currently, the only products stored in my db.json server are from one of my personal favorite stores - *Anthropologie* (thank you for the product images, prices, and names Anthropologie.com!). But imagine how this application might be expanded upon beyond hitting the minimum project requirements of Phase 1 of the Flatiron Program?

While searching for the perfect dress for an upcoming occasion, I wish I could search *Anthropologie*, *Madewell*, and *Urban Outfitters* all at the same time. I could implement additional properties to the objects in my server that define products by store, style, price, and gender. Filters could be added to the DOM that account for all of these functionalities and make the application useful for all parties to shop their favorite stores at once.

I hope you enjoy my application, and happy shopping!
